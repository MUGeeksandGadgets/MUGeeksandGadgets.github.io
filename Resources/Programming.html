                        A programming language is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior                         of a machine or to express algorithms.

                        C, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many                                 unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly                           language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.

                        C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operating system.[6] It has since become one of the most widely used programming                                 languages of all time, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the American National Standards                             Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

                        C# (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented                                   programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages                               designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

                        C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been                             found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL                                 servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided by various                                   organizations, including the FSF, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel and IBM.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest (and current) standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2014 as ISO/IEC 14882:2014 (informally                         known as C++14). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, ISO/IEC 14882:2003, standard. The current C++14 standard supersedes                         these and C++11, with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C                               language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for program organization.

                        <br/>
                        Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#, Java, and newer versions of C (after 1998).

                       HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It was finalized, and published, on 28 October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This is the fifth                              revision of the HTML standard since the inception of the World Wide Web. The previous version, HTML 4, was standardized in 1997.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Its core aims are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.).                         HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, HTML5 is a response to the fact that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web have a mixture of features introduced by various                               specifications, along with those introduced by software products such as web browsers and those established by common practice. It is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be                                     written in either HTML or XHTML. It includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and                                   introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a potential candidate for cross-platform mobile applications. Many                                     features of HTML5 have been designed with low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets taken in to consideration. In December 2011, research firm Strategy Analytics forecast sales of HTML5                                     compatible phones would top 1 billion in 2013.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        In particular, HTML5 adds many new syntactic features. These include the new video, audio and canvas elements, as well as the integration of scalable vector graphics (SVG) content (replacing generic                                   object tags) and MathML for mathematical formulas. These features are designed to make it easy to include and handle multimedia and graphical content on the web without having to resort to proprietary                                 plugins and APIs. Other new page structure elements, such as main, section, article, header, footer, aside, nav and figure, are designed to enrich the semantic content of documents. New                                               attributes have been introduced, some elements and attributes have been removed and some elements, such as a, cite and menu have been changed, redefined or standardized. The APIs and Document Object                                   Model (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification. HTML5 also defines in some detail the required processing for invalid documents so that syntax errors will be                             treated uniformly by all conforming browsers and other user agents.

                        Also to be considered with HTML is CSS.

                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user                           interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and                               JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

                        Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[13] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended                           to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[14] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[15] Java applications are                           typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2015, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[16][17][18][19]                             particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[citation needed] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by                             Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of                           them.

                        <br/>
                        The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licences. As of May 2007, in compliance with the                                       specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun                                     technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).

                        <br/>
                        The latest version is Java 8, which is the only version currently supported for free by Oracle, although earlier versions are supported both by Oracle and other companies on a commercial basis.

Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential                         technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions,                         making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include                         any I/O, such as networking, storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

                        Despite some naming, syntactic, and standard library similarities, JavaScript and Java are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The syntax of JavaScript is actually derived from C, while the                         semantics and design are influenced by the Self and Scheme programming languages.

                        JavaScript is also used in environments that are not web-based, such as PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon                         them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side web applications. On the client side, JavaScript has been traditionally implemented as an interpreted language, but more recent browsers                           perform just-in-time compilation. It is also used in game development, the creation of desktop and mobile applications, and server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js.

                        PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is                         now produced by The PHP Group. While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, it now stands for the recursive backronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

                        PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various Web template systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in                           the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the                               generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.

                        The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system                           and platform, free of charge.

                        The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as a de facto standard. Since 2014 work has been ongoing to create a formal PHP                           specification.

                        Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than                           would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large-scale.

                        <br/>
                        Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has                         a large and comprehensive standard library.

                        Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Python code execution on a wide variety of systems. Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller, Python code                           can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems, allowing the distribution of Python-based software for use on those environments without requiring the                             installation of a Python interpreter.

                        CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open-source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the                           non-profit Python Software Foundation.
