                        Welcome to the about us page!  Here you will find out what our values are, who the officers are, and some images of the club at work (aka play :) )  To keep up to date with our most recent activities the moment they happen, please feel free to like our Facebook page. Link is at the bottom of the page.

                <h2 id="values">The Way of the Geek</h2>
                    <h3>Values</h3>
                        <p>
                            Geeks and Gadgets has three club values:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Make it fun!</li>
                                <li>Make it cool!</li>
                                <li>Make it open source!</li>
                            </ul>
                            We hold these values dear as they are the very core of what the club is about; having fun while make a cool open source project.
                            We also highly value democracy and cooperation, two things that are absolutely neccesary for any project to come to a successful end.
                            The geeks are all about being open and transparent, one of the reasons why we support open source. Don't believe us? Fine, we encourage the question everything attitude! Here is our <a target="_blank" class="link" href="contents/Geeks%20and%20Gadgets%20Constitution.pdf">Constitution</a> so you can check it our for yourself!
                        </p>
                        <p>Privacy is also a very high priority to the geeks. With social media integrating so heavily into our society and having the ability to google ourselves, does privacy still exist? We aim to educate people about what their rights are with technology and how to protect their privacy as well as how to better use that technology to get more out of life.
                        </p>
                    <h3>What is Open Source and Why do I Care?</h3>
                        <p>Imagine source code as a type of recipe that your grandmother uses. It has been passed down and changed by each person who has used it. She gave it to your grandmother who changed it, then to your mother who again changed it and then shared it with her friends who changed it again. That is open souce; the idea that you should be free to give out your source code to others who can change it and share it again, making it better with each new set of eyes that see the code.
                        </p>
                        <p>How is this beneficial? Simple. No one person knows everything, by allowing people to see and share the code, more people can contribute to it and make a better end product. What if it is a group of people working on it and not publishing code? The same principle applies, no single secluded group of people will have more expertise than the combined world.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is not specific only to programmers. Engineers, Journalists, this idea applies to everyone in every discipline. It is the idea that information should be openly shared in hopes of learning from others and teaching them with an end goal of making the world a better place through learning. Granted, some things shouldn't be shared, but for the most part information should be. There are plenty of companies that share this belief and are built on it. Just to name a few: Mozilla, Red Hat, Facebook, and The Linux Foundation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        How does this idea affect you today? Perhaps you have heard of something called the internet. The internet was created with open source ideas in mind, and has thrived because of it. Open source gave birth to Linux, an open source operating system. Due to its open nature, Linux has thrived and you use it everyday. The stock market, smart TVs, and even nuclear submarines are powered by Linux. Pretty cool huh? Open source technology surrounds you and affects you everyday. Just imagine if more people would release those recipes, who knows what kind of pies we could make!
